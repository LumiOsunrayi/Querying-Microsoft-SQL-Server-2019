# Querying-Microsoft-SQL-Server-2019
During my Master of Business Analytics degree program, I took a Database Foundations class that covered querying data using Microsoft SQL Server up to the intermediate level. However, to hone my skills, be better prepared for the job market and perhaps learn something new, I decided to take an intermediate LinkedIn Learning course - Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2019 by Adam Wilbert.

The course uses Microsoft SQL Server 2019 and the AdventureWorks2017 database.

The following topics were covered during the course;

Introduction to T-SQL Queries - SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, Aliases, Constants

Additional Filter Techniques - TOP, DISTINCT, Comparison Operators, NULL Values, LIKE, Wildcards

Retrieving Records from Multiple Tables using Left, Right, Inner, Cross, and Full Outer Joins

Grouping Records using GROUP BY, COUNT, Aggregate Functions, SUM, and HAVING

Manipulating Data with String, Mathematical, IIF Logical and Date Functions

Writing SQL Scripts by changing database context with USE, adding comments to a script, and knowing when to use square brackets

Introduction to SQL Subqueries - Using subquery in a WHERE clause, Correlated Subqueries, and PIVOT the result set

Creating new variables and a counter for a looping statement

Result Set Operators - UNION, EXCEPT, INTERSECT
