# Querying-Microsoft-SQL-Server-2019
During my Master of Business Analytics degree program, I took a Database Foundations class that covered querying data using Microsoft SQL Server up to the intermediate level. However, to hone my skills, be better prepared for the job market and perhaps learn something new, I decided to take an intermediate LinkedIn Learning course - Querying Microsoft SQL Server 2019 by Adam Wilbert.

The course uses Microsoft SQL Server 2019 and the AdventureWorks2017 database.

My learning is in progress. I have covered the following topics;

What is Transact SQL?

The SQL querying environment

Return records with SELECT and FROM

Filter records with WHERE

Sort records with ORDER BY

Column aliases

Create value with constants

Limit results with TOP

Remove duplicates with DISTINCT

Comparison operators

Understand NULL values

Match text with LIKE and wildcards

Table joins and relationships

Inner, left, right, cross, and full outer joins

Understand record grouping

Use GROUP BY and COUNT

Aggregate functions

Explore data with SUM

Filter groups with HAVING

The rest of the course covers using functions in T-SQL, writing SQL scripts and subqueries, working with variables and result set operators.
